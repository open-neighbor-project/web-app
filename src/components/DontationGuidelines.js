    <h2>Donations:</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      We are working with local charities and food banks to identify people that
      need supplies and groceries donations because of restricted funds. We will
      post requests for delivery that entail picking up these donations and
      delivering them to those in need. If anyone has any questions, please feel
      free to reach out here or message directly - we are hoping to keep the
      hotline available for those in need. This has grown beyond our
      expectation, this is such a great community that's come together, please
      treat each other kindly and with patience, and if you have any suggestions
      or recommendations, we are more than happy to connect! Thank you so much
      again for joining the Good Neighbour Project - GTA and for exchanging
      resources and networks with each other!
    </p>
